<p>Welcome to the section <strong>"A Closer Look at Functions"</strong>!</p>
<p>
  If you want to progress through the course faster, only watch the videos
  marked as <strong>"Very Important"</strong> (dark green). But if you have
  time, then of course watch everything

  I still advise you to watch everything, but if you're in a hurry, feel free to
  skip the <strong>"Optional"</strong>
