<p>
    Welcome to the section
    <strong>"JavaScript in the Browser: DOM and Events Fundamentals"</strong>!
</p>
<p>
    If you want to progress through the course faster, only watch the videos
    marked as <strong>"Very Important"</strong> (dark green). But if you have
    time, then of course watch everything
</p>

    <strong>This is a project section, so videos build on one another</strong>.
    That's why most videos are marked as very important. But this will change in
    future sections
</p>
<p>
    I still advise you to watch everything, but if you're in a hurry, feel free to
    skip the <strong>"Optional"</strong> (lightest green) and
    <strong>"Good to know"</strong> (light green) videos. Then, if you ever need
    one of the topics you skipped, just come back to the video later
</p>
<p>And now, have fun coding!</p>
